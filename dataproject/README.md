# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **The Danish Tax Burden** and is about the development in the danish tax burden during the period 2004 to 2016.

We investigate how the tax burden have been affected by the overall economic cycle and political actions in the concerned period, focusing on especially the effect on income taxes. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **uses two datasets from Statistics Denmark**:

1. NAN1 imported from from statistikbanken.dk/NAN1
1. SKAT downloaded from statistikbanken.dk/SKAT

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst``
