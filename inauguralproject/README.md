# Inaugural project

In this project we look at a simple model reflecting the tax reform that will be implemeted in Denmark in 2024. 

The model consist of a household who derives utility from consumption of housing and other consumption. The household is endowed with an amount of cash-on-hand and is subject to a budget constraint, consisting of the price of other consumption and the cost ohousing, where the cost on housing depends on the interest rate, a base housing tax and a progressive housing tax. 

We define a function, which solves the consumer maximization problem, indicated by the model we where given. We use this function to investigate, how optimal housing consumption is affected by changes in housing taxation, while assuming a lognormal income distribution.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
